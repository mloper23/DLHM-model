# DLHM Model

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the Realistic DLHM (Digital Lensless Holographic Microscopy) model in both MATLAB and Python. The core functionality is provided in the `realistic_dlhm.m` (MATLAB) and `realistic_dlhm.py` (Python) files, while the corresponding main scripts are available in `main_realistic_dlhm.m` and `main_realistic_dlhm.py` for MATLAB and Python, respectively.

## Features

- **DLHM Model:** Simulate DLHM holograms.
- **Dual Language Support:** The model is implemented in both MATLAB and Python to cater to users of different preferences.
- **Reconstruction Scripts**: Scripts for reconstructing holograms are available in `reconstruction_dlhm.m` and `reconstruction_dlhm.py`. These scripts perform hologram reconstruction using the angular spectrum method with spherical wavefront sources, considering sampling requirements.

## Usage

### MATLAB

1. Open `main_dlhm.m` in MATLAB.
2. Adjust parameters if needed.
3. Run the script.

### Python

1. Open `main_dlhm.py` in a Python environment.
2. Configure the environment and adjust parameters as required.
3. Execute the script.

## Data

The `data` folder includes a simulated hologram image, which can be used with the reconstruction scripts for testing purposes. For more details on the validation data, refer to the paper. A DOI link will be provided once it becomes available.

## Paper

More information about the DLHM model and experimental results can be found in the associated paper. The DOI link will be added to this README once it is available.
